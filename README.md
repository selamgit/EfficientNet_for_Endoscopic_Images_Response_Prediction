##  Endoscopic images and clinical variables to predict the response to radiation therapy
 
### Background and Aim

- Accurate response evaluation is necessary to select complete responders from rectal cancer patients diagnosed and treated with radiotherapy.

- The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of response prediction with deep learning methods based on endoscopic images and clinical features.

### Dataset
* 722 endoscopic images with clinical variables having 6 features 
* Roughly out of 722 records half of them are complete responses and half of them are non-complete responses.

### During endoscopic images and combined model training
* Basic augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, shearing, and zooming of the original images) are used.
* Since endoscopic images are RGB natural images, transfer learning from ImageNet was also used.

## Results

| Dataset | Model | AUC | 
| ------------- | -------------| -------------| 
| Clinical variables  (with all 6 features) | FFN | 74%| 
| Selected clinical variables (with selected 3 features) | FFN | 76%| 
| Endoscopic image  (trained in endoscopic images only) | EfficientNet-B2 | 79%| 
| Combined model (endoscopic image and selected clinical features) | EfficientNet-B2 | 84%|
