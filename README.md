##  Endoscopic images and clinical variables to predict the response of radiation therapy
 
### Background and Aim

- Accurate response evaluation is necessary to select complete responders from rectal cancer patients diagnosed and treated with radiotherapy.

- The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of response prediction with deep learning methods based on endoscopic images and clinical features.

### Dataset
* 722 endoscopic images with clinical variables having 6 features (out of 722 records half of them are complete response and half of them are non-complete response).

### Code
* [Clinical variables model for response prediction (Clinical features model)](endoscopy_clinical_features_for_response_prediction.ipynb)

## Results
                    
  Dataset | Model | AUC 
------------- | -------------
Cinical variables (with all 6 features) | FFN | 74%
Selected cinical variables (with selected 3 features) | FFN | 76%
Endoscopic image (trained in endoscpic images only) | EfficientNet-B2 | 79%
Combined model (endoscopic image and selected clinical features) | EfficientNet-B2 | 84%
